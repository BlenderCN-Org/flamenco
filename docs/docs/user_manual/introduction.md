# Introduction

This manual requires minimal amount of programming knowledge, although some familiarity with CLI
(command line interfaces) is required. In the following pages, we are going to cover topics such
as installation, configuration and execution of jobs.

If are working in a pre-configured environment (e.g. artist working in a studio), and you work with
Blender, you might want to check ou the Blender Render section.
