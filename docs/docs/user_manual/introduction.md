# Introduction

This manual requires a minimal amount of programming knowledge, although some familiarity with CLI
(command line interfaces) is required. In the following pages, we are going to cover topics such
as [installation, configuration](installation.md), and execution of jobs.

If are working in a pre-configured environment (e.g. artist working in a studio), and you work with
Blender, you might want to check out the [Blender Render](blender_render.md) section.
