# Flamenco Docs

Welcome to the Flamenco Documentation pages! Here we collect both development and user docs.
Flamenco is primarily a distributed render management solution, but it is designed to support any
kind of job that can be split across multiple machines.

Currently Flamenco is used for Render Management at Blender Institute, so it's heavily tested for
Blender jobs, but it is quite trivial to add more.

## Main features

* Every component runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows
* Resilient design (individual components can fail without immediate disruption)
* Dependency-graph based priority system
* Extensible Jobs, Tasks, and Commands

## Status of the documentation

We are currently updating the documentation after a large rewrite of Flamenco, therefore the user
manual is not available, and the developer docs are work in progress. We have removed any legacy
content, though, so everything that can be found here is up to date, or has been highlighted as
upcoming functionality.
