# Flamenco Docs

Flamenco is a distributed rendering solution for the 3D animation suite
Blender. It supports many features that make it a perfect fit for a small
or medium CG studio, such as workstations/nodes availability scheduling,
project management, render previews via web interface, pre and post-render
actions.

## Main features

* Runs on Linux, macOS and Windows
* Automatic detection of clients
* Supports multiple Projects
* Stats on shot completions
* Priority system


## Supported software

Flamenco is designed to be quite flexible and support other software than
just Blender. The integration of other packages is not possible just yet
but if you are interested to work on this, feel free to get in touch and
we will figure out how to do it.
